# Frogger

This is a project made for Introduction to computer graphics, it consists of a game cloned from the classic arcade game Frogger, but built using the OpenGL graphics library. The game features the same basic gameplay mechanics as the original Frogger, where players control a frog character and must navigate it across a busy road and a river while avoiding obstacles such as cars, trains, and boats.

The game uses 3D graphics and advanced lighting and shading effects provided by OpenGL to create a more immersive and visually appealing gaming experience. The player's frog is rendered in 3D, and the animations are smooth and realistic. The game environment such as the road and the river are also rendered in 3D, with realistic water and texture effects.
